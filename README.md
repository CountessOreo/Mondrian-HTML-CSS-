Mondrian Composition with HTML & CSS

This is a minimalist web project inspired by the iconic style of Piet Mondrian. The composition is built entirely using HTML and CSS, with a focus on CSS Grid and Flexbox layout techniques.

Project Overview

The goal of this project was to recreate a geometric, Mondrian-style artwork using nothing but clean and responsive front-end code. It uses:

    CSS Grid to structure the main layout

    Flexbox for internal alignment where needed

    Custom sizing with fixed and fractional units

    Clean color palette with classic Mondrian tones: red, blue, yellow, black, white

How to Run

    Clone or download the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mondrian-css-art.git

    Open index.html in your browser.

No dependencies or build tools required — it's pure HTML/CSS.
